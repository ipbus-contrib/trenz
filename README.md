# Trenz

This repository contains firmware designed to work with the IPBus firmware system ( see github.com/ipbus )
It implements an IPBus master on Trenz FPGA modules. At the moment only the TE0712 is supported.
Optionally, the MAC and IP addresses can be retrived from PROM

A the moment the code in this repository is deeply broken.

This firmware is supported on
a best-effort basis, and is provided on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without
limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

### How do I get set up? ###

The master firmware uses the [ipbb](https://github.com/ipbus/ipbb) build tool, and requires the ipbus system firmware.

The following example procedure should build an example bitfile for the Enclustra AX3 module mounted on a PM3 base board.

Note that a reasonably up-to-date operating system (e.g. Centos7) is required.    

If you are going to build on a computer outside of the CERN network, then you will need to run kerberos (kinit username@CERN.CH)).

These instructions assume that you have your Xilinx Vivado licensing already setup for your environment and have a licence for the Xilinx tri-mode Gigabit Ethernet core.

### Which Components Do I Use in My Design ? ###

This repository contains a version of the IPBus infrastructure block that reads MAC and IP address from PROM : [enclustra_ax3_pm3_macprom_infra.vhd](boards/enclustra_ax3_pm3/synth/firmware/hdl/enclustra_ax3_pm3_macprom_infra.vhd) . The ports are described in a [README.md](boards/enclustra_ax3_pm3/synth/firmware/hdl/README.md)

Inside [enclustra_ax3_pm3_macprom_infra.vhd](boards/enclustra_ax3_pm3/synth/firmware/hdl/enclustra_ax3_pm3_macprom_infra.vhd) there is a wrapper around the NEO430 soft core microprocessor, do
